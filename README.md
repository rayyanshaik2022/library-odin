## Finishing Remarks & Thoughts

I'm not super proud of this project, but it was important to finish due to being functional and a very light web app.

## Features & Improvements


## Issues & Todo

* __Functionality__ : The progress bar is not active/dynamic with the page count
* __Javascript__ : While the javascript logic is sound, some parts are redundant and the code could definitely be cleaned up
